*About the Cytosim-GUI project:*
This project was started by summer '22 when my lab moved to the new Henri Moissan building in Orsay and when experimental research had to be stopped for months.
Cytosim-GUI is a Graphic User Interface for MacOSX (Intel- and Apple Silicon-based computers) to be run on top of Francois Nedelec's Cytosim cytoskeleton simulator (https://gitlab.com/f-nedelec/cytosim). It is completely independent from Cytosim and will provide to the end user an interated control over Cytosim's configuration file edition, simulation runs, play, and production of results reports.
The application is completely written in Objective C and needs Apple XCode to be installed. The source code is free and can be used under the GNU licence.
