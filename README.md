**About Cytosim-GUI**
Cytosim-GUI is a Graphic User Interface for MacOSX (Intel- and Apple Silicon-based computers) to be run on top of Francois Nedelec's Cytosim cytoskeleton simulator (https://gitlab.com/f-nedelec/cytosim). It is completely independent from Cytosim and will provide to the end user an interated control over Cytosim's configuration file edition, simulation run, play and results report.
The application is completely written in Objective C and needs Apple XCode to be installed.

# For more detailed instructions on how to compile and operate Cytosim-GUI, please refer to the Cytosim-GUI.md file in the CYtosim GUI folder of this repository.
